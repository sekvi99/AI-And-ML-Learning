Monkeys are primates divided into two main groups: Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys (found in Central and South America).
Capuchin monkeys are known for their intelligence and tool use - they can crack nuts with stones and use sticks to extract insects from tree bark.
Howler monkeys are among the loudest animals on Earth - their calls can be heard up to 3 miles away through dense forest.
Many New World monkeys have prehensile tails that act like a fifth hand, allowing them to grasp branches and objects with remarkable dexterity.
Japanese macaques (snow monkeys) are the northernmost-living primates and have been observed bathing in hot springs to keep warm during winter.
Proboscis monkeys have distinctively large noses that amplify their calls and are found only in the mangrove forests of Borneo.
Spider monkeys are excellent brachiators, swinging through trees using only their arms and covering up to 40 feet in a single swing.
Vervet monkeys have different alarm calls for different predators - distinct calls for eagles, leopards, and snakes that trigger specific escape behaviors.
Mandrill monkeys are the largest primates after great apes, with males displaying brilliant blue and red facial coloring that intensifies during mating season.
Golden lion tamarins were once critically endangered with only 200 individuals left in the wild, but conservation efforts have helped their population recover to over 3,000.
